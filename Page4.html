        <h4>WHAT PERSONAL DATA WE COLLECT, AND WHY</h4>
        <p>In order to support our network of events it is critical we understand who is participating. There are many reasons for this, from simple stuff like providing participants with information around how and when they have taken part, through to more complex challenges such as measuring the impact of our events on those communities most in need of increasing their physical activity levels and social engagement.
          The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Data Protection Act 2018 (DPA) require that all information we collect must be done so under a specific lawful basis. We categorize the majority of our data processing under three of those: Contract, Legitimate Interests and Consent.
