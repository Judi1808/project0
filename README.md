# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

In README.md, include a short writeup describing your project, whatâ€™s contained in each file, and (optionally) any other additional information the staff should know about your project.

I've created a 4 page website for an event that I run each week.  There is an existing site that I designed using WordPress, so this is a basic replica thereof.  I look forward to gleaning the necessary knowledge to upgrade the site well past this basic one, and eventually having an all new feature rich live site to replace the current, live WordPress site.

Files in this project include:

README.md   - this page
styles.css  - style sheet
index.html  - home page describing the event
page2.html  - registration page
page3.html  - disclaimer
page4.html  - privacy policy
