# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

In README.md, include a short writeup describing your project, whatâ€™s contained in each file, and (optionally) any other additional information the staff should know about your project.

I've created a 4 page website for an event that I run each week.  There is an existing live site that I designed using WordPress. This is a very basic replica thereof using the knowledge gleaned to date.

Files in this project include:

README.md   - this page

index.html  - Home page describing the event, including the container heading, table navigation bar - both these are on all pages, an image and some text followed by the footer table, also featured on all pages.
page2.html  - registration page - heading and navigation bar repeated, followed by a form using different input methods - text, number, date, radio and check box.  At the bottom is a media query that prints the Strava url if a paper copy is generated, but has a click button to the Strava site if you're on-screen.  
page3.html  - disclaimer - text page outlining the 'rules' of participation
page4.html  - privacy policy - - text page outlining the 'rules' of participation

styles.css  - style sheet - originally began css coding, after lecture 1 I used SASS and created the new SASS stylesheet with the conversion and my terminal window and 'gitwatch'.
styles.scss - as explained above
styles.css. map - auto generated file from compiler


I look forward to gleaning the necessary knowledge to upgrade the site well past this basic one, and eventually having an all new feature rich live site to replace the current, live WordPress site.  My biggest frustration at the moment is getting the form to be live and to link to a Google forms spreadsheet that will automatically update for me each time somebody registers.
